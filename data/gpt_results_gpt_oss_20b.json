Pack coffee grounds + a handful of alfalfa sprouts into a cotton tee, sealing loosely. 2. Alfalfa ferments, producing a small, localized heat due to microbial activity and CO\u2082 buildup. 3. The tee warms your face when you exhale CO\u2082, making your breath \u201cheat\u2011shielded\u201d in crowded, low\u2011temperature zones. | Keep the pack small (< 2\u202foz). Use a plain, faded shirt to avoid suspicion. |\n| **2** | **\u201cMimic\u2011Moss\u201d Skin\u2011Patch** | - Moss (from forest floor)<br>- Clear dental floss<br>- Rubber band | 1. Tie a strip of dental floss through moss, securing with a rubber band. 2. The moss absorbs sweat and moisture; its translucent cells reflect body heat outward, creating a shimmering \u201ccamouflage\u201d effect. 3. When placed on a limb, it blends with ambient foliage or wall textures. | Use moss from a neutral, unmonitored area. Store the patch in a small cloth pouch. |\n| **3** | **Fermented\u2011Food \u201cEnzyme\u201d Gel** | - Yogurt (plain)<br>- Garlic cloves<br>- Plastic bottle cap | 1. Crush garlic, mix into yogurt, let sit 1\u20132\u202fhrs. 2. The resulting gel contains lactase and mild proteases that degrade simple polymers (e.g., plastic cling\u2011film). 3. When a broken piece of plastic is wrapped in the gel, it slowly dissolves in minutes, freeing the material for reuse. | Keep the gel in a sealed cap; the aroma is mild and can be masked with a drop of mint oil. |\n| **4** | **\u201cDust\u2011Pulse\u201d Micro\u2011Ecosystem** | - Bread crumbs<br>- Soil (from a garden)<br>- Paperclip | 1. Mix crumbs with soil and tie with a paperclip to create a tiny \u201cbioreactor\u201d that produces methane from cellulose breakdown. 2. The methane can be captured in a small, hollowed\u2011out bottle cap and used as a bio\u2011fuel for a pocket torch (light a wick). 3. The process releases only CO\u2082, leaving no detectable trace. | Keep the reactor in a jar with a cork lid; avoid leaking by tightening the cork. |\n| **5** | **Bio\u2011Signal \u201cGlow\u2011Ink\u201d** | - Cucumber peel<br>- Lemon juice<br>- Crushed beetroot | 1. Slice cucumber, soak in lemon juice for 15\u202fmin. 2. Add crushed beetroot; the mixture fluoresces under UV light. 3. Dip a piece of parchment into the solution; the \u201cink\u201d dries slowly and can be used to write messages invisible in daylight but readable under a cheap UV lamp. | Store the ink in a small vial with a dropper to avoid accidental spills. |\n| **6** | **\u201cSubtle Scent\u2011Mask\u201d** | - Lavender sachet<br>- Tea bag<br>- Cotton swab | 1. Crush tea leaves, mix into a lavender sachet, add a cotton swab. 2. The mixture releases a mild, natural perfume that masks human sweat with a herbal note. 3. Use when moving through checkpoints to mask odor signatures. | Ensure the sachet is empty of visible leaves to avoid suspicion. |\n| **7** | **\u201cMicro\u2011Filter\u201d Sponge** | - Old T\u2011shirt<br>- Cotton wool<br>- Paper clips | 1. Cut a circle from the shirt, sew a cotton\u2011wool layer inside with clips. 2. The sponge can be used to absorb toxins from a water source; the cotton releases cellulose\u2011based enzymes that degrade small molecules. 3. After use, wash in hot water to reset. | Keep the sponge small and folded; can be tucked in a pocket. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Implementation Guide\n\n1. **Source Materials**  \n   - Use scavenged or household items (coffee grounds, yogurt, moss).  \n   - Avoid buying or carrying exotic ingredients.\n\n2. **Assembly**  \n   - Perform assembly in",

Four figures\u2014JAX, LENA, MARCO, and SARAH\u2014cluster around a battered metal table. On the table lie a battered **kettle**, a long **rope**, a stack of **plastic bottles**, and a half\u2011used **phone**.*\n\n**JAX** *(glancing at the clock)*  \nWe have fifteen minutes to get the signal off. If we\u2019re not careful, the whole city will drown.\n\n**LENA** *(tightening her grip on the kettle)*  \nTime\u2019s running, so no wasted steps. Think of the kettle as more than hot water\u2014it's a container, a weight, a decoy.\n\n**MARCO** *(picking up the rope)*  \nIt can be a rope, yes. But also a line. Pull the right people, or pull them away.\n\n**SARAH** *(tugging at a plastic bottle)*  \nAnd that bottle? Looks like just a bottle. But remember how we used the glass to break a window earlier? Same principle\u2014refract light, create a flash, or... keep things cool.\n\n**JAX**  \nRight. The bottle\u2019s surface is a perfect lens. With a bit of force, we can redirect the burst from the phone\u2019s battery\u2014an explosive signal, but we can redirect it into a blind spot.\n\n**LENA**  \nAnd the phone? Not just a phone. Think of it as a transmitter, a timer. If we short it with the kettle\u2019s metal, we can trigger a burst that knocks out the jammer. Then we\u2019re blind, but we\u2019re also deaf to the sensors.\n\n**MARCO** *(folding the rope into a loop)*  \nLoop it around the kettle\u2019s handle. We can throw it like a boomerang\u2014push it, it returns. That\u2019s our escape route and a way to snag the signal\u2019s conduit.\n\n**SARAH**  \nAnd the bottle? We can use the liquid inside as a lubricant\u2014slip through the vents, or to dampen the echo of footsteps. We\u2019ll need to slip past the guards, we can use it to slick the floor and make our footsteps silent.\n\n**JAX** *(eyes darting to a distant point)*  \nWe\u2019re not fighting a manhunt, we\u2019re racing a countdown. The kettle is our shield, the rope is our bridge, the bottle is our trick, and the phone is our trump card. If we get each piece in the right place, at the right time, we can melt the lock, silence the alarms, and get to the core.\n\n**LENA** *(with fierce resolve)*  \nLet\u2019s make it happen. Every item we\u2019re holding is a weapon or a tool. It\u2019s not about what it is, but how we use it\u2014fast, quiet, lethal.\n\n*The four nod. They move with practiced precision, each item becoming part of a seamless, improvised attack that would either save the city or doom it. The clock ticks, and the warehouse hums with the urgency of a battle where every mundane object is a blade, a rope, or a shield.*",
